                                    <p class="card_text " style="width: auto;height: 150px;">Kovalam is an
                                        internationally renowned beach with three adjacent crescent beaches. It has been
                                        a favourite haunt of tourists since the 1930s. A massive rocky promontory on the
                                        beach has created a beautiful bay of calm waters ideal for sea bathing.

                                        The leisure options at this beach are plenty and diverse. Sunbathing, swimming,
                                        herbal body toning massages, special cultural programmes and catamaran cruising
                                        are some of them. The tropical sun acts so fast that one can see the faint blush
                                        of coppery tan on the skin in a matter of minutes. Life on the beach begins late
                                        in the day and carries on well into the night. The beach complex includes a
                                        string of budget cottages, Ayurvedic health resorts, convention facilities,
                                        shopping zones, swimming pools, Yoga and Ayurvedic massage centres.

                                        Accommodation facilities for tourists at Kovalam range from five star hotels to
                                        budget hotels and the choice of food available at restaurants and cafeterias
                                        range from Continental varieties to South Indian delicacies.

                                        Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, is just 16 km away from Kovalam
                                        and getting there is no hassle. But if you are on holiday it is better to stay
                                        in Kovalam and visit the city. The city of Thiruvananthapuram has many
                                        interesting places to see like the Napier Museum, the Sri Chitra Art Gallery and
                                        the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The SMSM Institute, a State owned handicrafts
                                        emporium, is the ideal place to pick up ethnic curios and other articles.

                                        Fort in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of the State of Kerala in India is
                                        the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. This temple is a
                                        blend of the Kerala and Dravidian styles of architecture. It is believed to be
                                        the world’s richest temple.

                                        The history of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple dates back to 8th century. It is one
                                        of the 108 sacred Vishnu temples or Divya Desams in India. Divya Desams are the
                                        holiest abodes of Lord Vishnu that are mentioned in the works of the Tamil
                                        Azhvars (saints). The presiding deity of this temple is Lord Vishnu, reclining
                                        on Anantha, the hooded Serpent.

                                        Marthanda Varma, noted among Travancore kings, did a major renovation to the
                                        temple and it resulted in the present day structure of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy
                                        Temple. It was Marthanda Varma who introduced the Murajapam and Bhadra Deepam
                                        festivals in the temple. Murajapam, which literally means continuous chanting of
                                        prayers, is still conducted in the temple once every six years.

                                        In 1750, Marthanda Varma dedicated the kingdom of Travancore to Lord Padmanabha.
                                        Marthanda Varma vowed that the royal family will rule the State on behalf of the
                                        Lord and he and his descendants would serve the kingdom as Padmanabha Dasa or
                                        the Servant of Lord Padmanabha. Since then the name of every Travancore King was
                                        preceded by the title Padmanabha Dasa. The donation of the kingdom of Travancore
                                        to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thripadidanam.

                                        Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala takes its name from the presiding
                                        deity of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, who is also known as Anantha (one who
                                        reclines on the Serpent Anantha). The word 'Thiruvananthapuram' literally means
                                        - the Land of Sree Anantha Padmanabhaswamy.

                                        The Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as per belief is located at a place that is
                                        considered as one of the seven Parasurama Kshetras. There are references to the
                                        temple in texts like the Puranas, viz. the Skanda Purana and Padma Purana. The
                                        temple stands close to the holy tank - Padma Theertham, which means 'lotus
                                        spring.'

                                        The shrine is currently run by a trust headed by the erstwhile royal family of
                                        Travancore.

                                        species. It can be viewed from near Neyyar Dam as well as Bonacaud.
                                        Agasthyakoodam is also known for its remarkable flora and fauna, especially
                                        certain rare medicinal herbs which have been discovered here. Over 2000 species
                                        including lichens, orchids, mosses and ferns have been recorded in the area.

                                        The peak was named after the sage Agasthya and is a popular pilgrim site. A
                                        shrine dedicated to him is located here and is frequented by devotees. The air
                                        itself is said to have medicinal qualities. The peak is a 90 minute drive with
                                        Bonacaud being the last motorable spot. Trekking is restricted as only a few
                                        people are allowed to go up the peak. One must get a forest pass from the
                                        wildlife office in Thiruvananthapuram with January to April being the
                                        recommended months.
